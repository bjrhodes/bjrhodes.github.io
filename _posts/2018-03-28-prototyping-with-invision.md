## What is Invision?

Invision is a simple idea, well executed. Using it you can upload a collection of images to the web, and then identify and link hot-spots. When a visitor clicks these hot-spots the image is replaced with an alternate image. This gives the impression of clicking through a working application without needing any code to be written at all.

## Why do I like using it?

Invision is a great tool for a design team to get interactive prototypes up and running on the web without any code. This provides a great way to cheaply try out ideas in the early stages of a project, and iterate quickly through a wide variety of concepts.

In turn, this allows the team to quickly hit on the best solution for the client and their budget. The client can see exactly what they'll get and the developer can estimate a lot more easily. As an added bonus, a lot of to and fro time is saved as the designer's intent is so much clearer. This means that everyone involved can maximise their time doing what they do best; designing and building great software for the web.
