I'm Barry Rhodes, a full stack web developer specialising in JavaScript and PHP. I love the freedom that the internet represents and I try to leave my little corner of the web in a better state than I came to it with every project. This means working with the best designers, considering the accessibility needs of all users and always applying best-practice workmanship to every process and every task at hand.

This site is a small slice of things I've found of interest in work and in life. If it interests you too, have a look around, and you can reach me on my social channels. Even better, if you think I might be a good fit for a project which you are passionate about bringing to life, my contact details are dotted around the site.

Hopefully, I'll be speaking with you soon!
