*I was approached by a local branding and design agency who were working on a site for charity and needed a team to build it out. Working with some preferred partners, we built a bespoke theme to enable them to more easily and rapidly shout about their accomplishments and increase charitable donations through the site*

The Foundation felt that the current site required a more simple administrative interface as their current setup involved a lot of knowledge of HTML to keep updated. They also had a very high bounce rate on mobile devices, as the original site was aging and not responsive.

To accommodate these needs, we pre-built a variety of responsive components to display the most common types of story that the charity displayed. We then stripped back the admin interface and inserted a new, simpler control to choose a component and populate the content they wish to display.

No coding, or even design, knowledge is needed, there is not a large and complex variety of post-types and archives to manage and the content is always presented in an attractive fashion.
