## Matchhero were a small startup when they originally approached me, with a goal of redefining how young people engage with sports.

They had already commissioned a working prototype elsewhere, and needed an urgent small job completing on their existing Laravel application as their regular developer was unavailable. I added one-click social logins to their site and, whilst were integrating that, discovered a few minor breaches of best-practice, which they passed on to their regular developer and had resolved swiftly. They weren't entirely happy with the look of the application though, and so approached me to implement a design refresh.

Working with a partner designer, we collaborated on a bang-for-buck project to refresh the look and feel of the user interface with minimal time on project and minimum disruption to existing users. Targeted tweaks to typography, spacing and rhythm provided a much more modern UI within the feasibility of a small startup budget.

Since these early days, I've taken on hosting and maintenance of the many facets of Matchhero's offerings. I've given their Laravel codebase a complete overhaul to bring in line with best practice and extended the app with plenty of new features. Of particular relevance to the bottom line was an automated invoice generation feature alongside automatic rebilling using Stripe and PayPal. Matchhero have also branched out internationally, and I've enabled them to refocus and redeploy their core offering toward other sports, popular amongst other cultures.
